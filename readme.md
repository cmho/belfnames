# World of Warcraft Name Generator

Generates surnames in the format of [Noun][noun], [Noun][verber], [Adjective][noun], etc., drawing from the canonical names of World of Warcraft NPCs and lore characters.  Used to be only blood elvesâ€”I should probably rename the repo.

Also, apparently Draenei just don't have surnames? I found like one with a surname on the wiki.  What's up with that? (They're kind of sparse for trolls, too.)

If I get bored I might see if I can parse all the first names into some kind of magic generating thing, too.  It'd make naming new characters way easier, for one thing.
